Feature: Rule modification
  
  As an operation manager
  I want to modify rules associated to an origin in order to update them
  So that I can modified the instances discovery according to my needs on the fly

  Scenario Outline: Binding update to valid rules params and values
    Given the user performing the operation is:
      | username | password |
      | admin    | admin    |
    And a class has already been published with data <old_class_index>:
      | class_name | description | default_version |
      | Class      | New Class   | v1.0            |
    And an instance has already been published with data <old_instance_index>:
      | version | uri                    |
      | v1.0    | http://instance.tid.es |
    And the following bindings rules are available <old_rule_index>:
      | operation | input_context_param | value   |
      | range     | uidd                | 100,200 |
    And the previous bindings are pusblished for the context <old_binding_index>:
