	As a capability provider, I would like to have access to a web site for being able to delete a capability(api_name) exposed by the Service Directory.
 
    Scenario Outline: Deletion of a capability_TDAFBA-587
        Given a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And the admin is logged
        When I go to "$base_web_url/capabilities"
        And I press "remove-$api_name"
        And I press "del-capability"
        Then I should see "<web_message>"
        And the URL $base_api_url/$apis_url/$api_name/ returns the error code 404 with error code SVC0002
       
    Examples:
        | old_cap_index | web_message        |
        | 0             | Capability Removed |

    Examples:
        | old_cap_index | 
        | 0             |
