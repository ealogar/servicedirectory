	As a Service Directory Administrator I would like to be able to create a new capability exposing APIs in the Service Directory.
	This operation can only be mad from a user with admin role.
 
  Scenario: Web capability publication form layout_TDAFBA-563
        Given the DB is working
        And the admin is logged
        When I go to "$base_web_url/$add_cap_url"
        Then I should see "Fill to add a new Capability"

        And I should see "Capability Name"
        And I should see "Description"
        And I should see "Default Version"
        And The element with id of "api_name" contains placeholder "Capability Name"
        And The element with id of "description" contains placeholder "Description"
        And The element with id of "default_version" contains placeholder "1.0.0"

  Scenario Outline: Web capability page layout_TDAFBA-564
        Given the DB is working
        And a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And the admin is logged
        When I go to "$base_web_url/$capabilities_url"
