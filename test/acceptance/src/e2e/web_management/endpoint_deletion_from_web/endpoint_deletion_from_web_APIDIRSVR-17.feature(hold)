Feature: Endpoint Deleting from Web

	As a capability provider, I would like to have access to a web site for being able to delete the endpoints that are being exposed by the Service Directory.
 
    Scenario Outline: Deletion of an endpoint_TDAFBA-583
        Given a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And an endpoint has already been published with data <old_endpoint_index>:
            | version | url                    |
            | 1.0     | http://endpoint.tid.es |
        And the admin is logged
        When I go to "$base_web_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url"
        And I press "del-$endpoint_id"
        And I press "del-endpoint"
        Then I should see "<web_message>"
        And the URL $base_api_url/$apis_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url/$endpoint_id returns the error code 404 with error code SVC0002 
    
    Examples:
        | old_cap_index | old_endpoint_index | web_message      |
      	| 0             | 0                  | EndPoint Removed |     
        
    Scenario Outline: Deletion of an endpoint and confirmation message cancellation_TDAFBA-584
        Given a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And an endpoint has already been published with data <old_endpoint_index>:
            | version | url                    | environment | premium | ob |
            | 1.0     | http://endpoint.tid.es | integration | True    | ES |
        And the admin is logged
        And I store in world the endpoint with data <endpoint_index>:
            | version | url                    | environment | premium | ob |
            | 1.0     | http://endpoint.tid.es | integration | True    | ES |
        When I go to "$base_web_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url"
        And I press "del-$endpoint_id"
        And I press "close-del-endpoint"
        Then the URL $base_api_url/$apis_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url/$endpoint_id returns the endpoint data
        And I should see a form with csrf token
        And The element with id of "column-title-url" contains "URL"
        And The element with id of "column-title-version" contains "Version"
        And The element with id of "column-title-environment" contains "Environment"
        And The element with id of "column-title-ob" contains "OB"
        And The element with id of "column-title-premium" contains "Premium"
        And The element with id of "column-title-options" contains "Options"
        And I should see "$url"
        And I should see "$version"
        And I should see "$environment"
        And I should see "$ob"

    Examples:
        | old_cap_index | old_endpoint_index | endpoint_index |
        | 0             | 0                  | 0              |
