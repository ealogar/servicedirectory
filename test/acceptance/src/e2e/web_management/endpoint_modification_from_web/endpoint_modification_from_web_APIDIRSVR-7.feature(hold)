Feature: Endpoint Modification from Web

	As a capability provider, I would like to have access to a web site for being able to modify the endpoints that are being exposed by the Service Directory.
 
  Scenario Outline: Web endpoint modification form layout_TDAFBA-571
        Given the DB is working
        And a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And an endpoint has already been published with data <old_endpoint_index>:
            | version | url                    | environment | premium | ob |
            | 1.0     | http://endpoint.tid.es | integration | True    | ES |
        And the admin is logged
        When I go to "$base_web_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url"
        And I should see a form with csrf token
        And I press "edit-$endpoint_id"
        Then I should see "Edit endpoint: $api_name"
        And I should see a form with csrf token
        And I should see "Environment"
        And I should see "Version"
        And I should see "Url"
        And I should see "OB"
        And I should see "Premium"
        And The element with id of "versionField" contains placeholder "Version Number"
        And The element with id of "urlField" contains placeholder "Url"
        And The element with id of "obField" contains placeholder "OB identifier"
        And The "premiumField" checkbox should be checked
        Examples:
            | old_cap_index | old_endpoint_index |
            | 0             | 0                  |

    Scenario Outline: Web modification of an endpoint with valid mandatory data_TDAFBA-509

        And I store in world the endpoint "$environment", "<url>", "<version>", "null", "null"
        Then I should see "<web_message>"
        And the URL $base_api_url/$apis_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url/$endpoint_id returns the updated endpoint data
