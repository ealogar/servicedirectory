  Scenario Outline: Web capability modification form layout_TDAFBA-569
        Given the DB is working
        And a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And the admin is logged
        When I go to "$base_web_url/$capabilities_url"
        And I should see a form with csrf token
        And I press "edit-$api_name"
        Then I should see "Edit capability: $api_name"
        And I should see a form with csrf token
        And I should see "Description"
        And I should see "Default Version"
        And The element with id of "editDescriptionField" contains placeholder "Description"

Starlings, eagles, pigeons, sparrows, blackbirds, ducks, geese, and so on.\nThe birds enter the church. Gravely, silently, they file into the church and find their way to their seats in the wooden church pews.\nMusic plays. Then, the bird preacher enters the room, using a small door behind the main altar. The bird preacher makes a dramatic gesture. Then he clears his throat and addresses his congregation. | 1.0 | 0 | Capability Updated |
