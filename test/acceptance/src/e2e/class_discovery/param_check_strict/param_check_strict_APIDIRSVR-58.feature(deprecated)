Feature: PARAM_CHECK_STRICT

	Implement the behaviour PARAM_CHECK_STRICT for the endpoint discovery:
	PARAM_CHECK_STRICT: checks if all the query parameters have been defined for this {api_name}. In case some of then have not been defined, the request will be rejected. Launch an error if some parameter is not found or is not valid.
 
    Scenario Outline: Discovery by version of an endpoint with mandatory parameters, using PARAM_CHECK_STRICT_TDAFBA-449
        Given a capability has already been published with data <old_cap_index>:
            | api_name | description | default_version |
            | Cap      | Capability  | 1.0             |
        And an endpoint has already been published with data <old_endpoint_index>:
            | version | url                    |
            | 1.0     | http://endpoint.tid.es |
        # the premium param is not mandatory but is always set to False by default if not defined
        When I request the resource $base_api_url/$apis_url/$api_name/$endpoints_url with parameters <params_index>: 
            | version | behaviour          |
            | 1.0     | PARAM_CHECK_STRICT |
        Then I get a success response of type 200 with a result set of size 1:
        And the result set contains the endpoint <endpoint_index>:
            | api_name | version | url                    | environment | premium |
            | Cap      | 1.0     | http://endpoint.tid.es | production  | False   |
